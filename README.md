## ðŸ”° Project Introduction

**Project Title: Cik Siti Wan Kembang â€” Realistic Character Animation Workflow**

This project brings to life the legendary figure of **Cik Siti Wan Kembang**, a warrior queen from Malay folklore, through advanced AI-generated animation. Using the **`realistic_character_animation_workflow.json`** in **ComfyUI**, we generate realistic animated portraits and video sequences that reflect her strength, grace, and cultural significance.

### ðŸ“– Background

Cik Siti Wan Kembang is a revered historical and mythical figure believed to have ruled over the Kelantan region in the 14th century. She is celebrated for her beauty, wisdom, and fearless leadership in defending her kingdom from foreign threats. Her story is often linked with a mystical white deer, symbolizing her divine connection and noble spirit. She remains a powerful cultural icon, representing female empowerment, sovereignty, and the rich heritage of Malay traditions.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to merge cultural storytelling with modern generative AI tools to:

* **Animate historical figures with lifelike motion** such as blinking, subtle head turns, shoulder movement, and natural hair flow.
* **Preserve and promote Malay folklore** by introducing traditional legends through engaging, modern media formats.
* **Showcase the potential of AI in heritage visualization**, offering an immersive and emotionally resonant representation of iconic cultural figures.
